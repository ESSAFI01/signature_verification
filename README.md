# signature_verification
Signature verification is a vital application of machine learning, aimed at distinguishing between genuine and forged signatures. This project combines advanced machine learning techniques and comprehensive data preprocessing to develop a highly effective and robust signature verification system.

# Key Highlights
Preprocessing : 
Normalization: Standardizing data for consistent input.
Denoising: Removing noise to enhance image clarity.
Feature Extraction: Ensuring high-quality data representation for further analysis.
Feature Engineering : 
Extraction of geometric, texture, and statistical features to capture unique signature patterns effectively.
Machine Learning Models : 
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Handles high-dimensional data and complex decision boundaries.
Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective model for classification tasks.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Deep learning for capturing intricate spatial hierarchies in signatures.
