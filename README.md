# Signature Verification with Machine Learning

Signature verification is a crucial application of machine learning, aimed at distinguishing between genuine and forged signatures. This project combines advanced machine learning techniques and comprehensive data preprocessing to develop a highly effective and robust signature verification system.

## Key Features

- **Preprocessing**: Includes normalization, denoising, and feature extraction to ensure high-quality input data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extraction of geometric, texture, and statistical features to capture key patterns in signatures.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify signatures as genuine or forged.
  
## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the signature dataset used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks contains the cource code for preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
