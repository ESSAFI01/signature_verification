Signature Verification with Machine Learning
Signature verification is a critical application of machine learning, designed to distinguish between genuine and forged signatures. This project leverages advanced techniques in machine learning and data preprocessing to create an effective and robust signature verification system.

Key highlights include:

Preprocessing: Normalization, denoising, and feature extraction to ensure high-quality input data.
Feature Engineering: Extraction of geometric, texture, and statistical features to provide meaningful insights into signature patterns.
Machine Learning Models: Utilization of algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression and CNN.
